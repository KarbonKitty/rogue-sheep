# Rogue Sheep

Rogue Sheep is a .NET Core library aimed at helping in development of roguelikes. The goal is the offer both terminal emulation and basic tileset graphics (using SFML.Net backend), as well as algorithms useful for such games (most important ones would be field-of-view, pathfinding, map generation, and string formatting).
